# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to use an API, so after I checked some [public apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), this is what I found the most beginner friendly.

## Description

Made with [Router](https://reactrouter.com) and [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) using [Magic: The Gathering SDK](https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-javascript).
